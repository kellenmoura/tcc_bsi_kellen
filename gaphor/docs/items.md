# Items and Elements

Diagram items, or just items for short, represent the UML metamodel on a
diagram. In other words, they are the graphical objects in a diagram.
`DiagramItem` supports item style, text elements, and stereotypes.

Elements refer to the semantic model objects. `Element` is the base class
for the UML data classes.
